Experiment: Simulation and verification of an AND gate using the EDA Playground tool.

Description:
This experiment demonstrates the design and functional verification of a 2-input AND gate implemented in SystemVerilog. The simulation was carried out using the EDA Playground platform to verify the correctness of the logic through testbench execution and waveform observation.
